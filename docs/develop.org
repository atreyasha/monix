** Tasks
**** Next
***** TODO add ~sync~ target to monix and private makefiles which can sync certain files that need to be copied
****** figure out how to make this interact gracefully with code in ~test~ -> re-use test cases
***** TODO manually create basic directories such as ~downloads~ and ~desktop~ directory for qutebrowser
***** TODO commit ~downgrade.conf~ to repository as well with its own ~Makefile~ and test routine

**** Long-term
***** File-system encryption
****** practice this on virtual machine with new ~dotfiles~ workflows as well
****** reinstall arch on own hardware with encrypted version
****** add this information to readme pre-monix

***** Pacman hooks and/or update management scripts in ~dotfiles~
****** add a hook to convert all optional (non-true) orphans to explicit packages -> or at least to check them after each upgrade -> ~pacman -Qttdq~ 
****** *possible duplicate:* add pacman hook to update package lists + ~pip~ in ~monix~: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#List_of_installed_packages
****** *possible duplicate:* add a test hook after every system update to ensure tracked files are the same -> think of how to update configuration files in both directions seamlessly
       
***** Downgrade-related
****** add hook to automatically track downgraded packages as well and add conditional when installing them to check if the array is not empty -> coordinate with ~downgrade~
****** this should be synced with update management scripts in ~dotfiles~
****** add a new test suite to check for downgraded packages
