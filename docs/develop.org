****** add test suites to build repo which tests for necessary variables and runs
****** get all private files from private repo as well
****** reboot after installation

***** Next tasks
****** make script work such that re-installing can be done harmlessly even on fully installed system
****** add hook to automatically track downgraded packages as well and add conditional when installing them to check if the array is not empty
****** possibly add pacman hook to update package lists + ~pip~ in ~monix~: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#List_of_installed_packages
****** add a test hook after every system update to ensure tracked files are the same -> think of how to update configuration files in both directions seamlessly

***** Backup
****** figure out how to restore ~personal~ data
****** figure out how to restore private dotfiles like ~neomutt~, ~ssh~, ~gnupg~ and ~pass~ files -> to fully emulate current distribution
****** re-arrange system to keep personal data in single location, which should be backed up regularly
       
** Reproduction logs for Arch Linux
*** pacman
***** need to export specific files for this, including ~pacman.conf~ and ~pacman.d/*~ 
***** use ~pacdiff -o~ for checking differences in configuration files 
***** use ~paccache -rvk2~ to only keep last two caches
*** virtualization setup -> read Arch Wiki to confirm if anything must be done
*** ufw-firewall
***** copy config file
***** retain default settings that deny incoming requests while allowing outgoing
***** run =sudo systemctl enable ufw.service=, might need to be started as well
***** run =sudo ufw enable= to enable it outside systemd
