** Tasks
**** Next
***** TODO add ~sync~ target to monix and private makefiles which can sync certain files that need to be copied
***** TODO manually create basic directories such as ~downloads~ and ~desktop~ directory for qutebrowser

***** File-system encryption
****** practice this on virtual machine first and then migrate to real hardware
****** reinstall arch on own hardware with encrypted version
****** add this information to readme pre-monix
       
**** Long-term
***** Downgrade-related
****** add hook to automatically track downgraded packages as well and add conditional when installing them to check if the array is not empty -> coordinate with ~downgrade~
****** add a new test suite to check for downgraded packages

***** Pacman hooks
****** possibly add pacman hook to update package lists + ~pip~ in ~monix~: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#List_of_installed_packages
****** add a test hook after every system update to ensure tracked files are the same -> think of how to update configuration files in both directions seamlessly
****** add a hook to convert all optional (non-true) orphans to explicit packages -> or at least to check them after each upgrade -> ~pacman -Qttdq~ 

***** Backup
****** reduce size of ~personal~ directory to keep only important data 
****** optimize an elegant and portable backup scheduling of the ~personal~ directory
****** perhaps use tarballs with ~rsync~ to ensure only relevant data is updated
****** think of separating important and unimportant data -> only back up the important data
****** organize drive to ensure backups all make good sense
