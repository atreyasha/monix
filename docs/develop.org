** Tasks
**** TODO Next
***** use ~localectl~ to add X-keyboard-mapping file so it does not get forgotten and reset to ~us~ -> add this to routines, test and readme as well
****** consider removing this from ~.xinitrc~ since it is read from the system
****** think of which part of ~monix~ to place this in -> either readme or conf
****** test this routine with fixture of ~localectl~ command -> this should be better than using ~setxkbmap~ which is only necessary within an X session
****** possibly don't need to include hard file, just use ~localectl~ command once and add fixture to test
***** manually create basic directories such as ~downloads~ and ~desktop~ directory for qutebrowser
***** commit ~downgrade.conf~ to repository as well with its own ~Makefile~ and test routine
***** add ~sync~ target to monix and private makefiles which can sync certain files that need to be copied
****** figure out how to make this interact gracefully with code in ~test~ -> re-use test cases

**** Long-term
***** File-system encryption
****** practice this on virtual machine with new ~dotfiles~ workflows as well
****** reinstall arch on own hardware with encrypted version
****** add this information to readme pre-monix

***** Pacman hooks and/or update management scripts in ~dotfiles~
****** add a hook to convert all optional (non-true) orphans to explicit packages -> or at least to check them after each upgrade -> ~pacman -Qttdq~ 
****** *possible duplicate:* add pacman hook to update package lists + ~pip~ in ~monix~: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#List_of_installed_packages
****** *possible duplicate:* add a test hook after every system update to ensure tracked files are the same -> think of how to update configuration files in both directions seamlessly 
       
***** Repository workflow
****** consider replacing ~cp~ with ~rsync~, which can preserve directory trees -> can encode directories similar to ~stow~ but with hard files instead of links
****** think about combining home and root partitions, such that ~monix~ can be used effectively with ~stow~ instead of copied files
******* need to think more about the practicality and necessity of this
******* or try repository again using stow to check if things work

***** Downgrade-related
****** add hook to automatically track downgraded packages as well and add conditional when installing them to check if the array is not empty -> coordinate with ~downgrade~
****** this should be synced with update management scripts in ~dotfiles~
****** add a new test suite to check for downgraded packages
