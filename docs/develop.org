** Tasks
*** Arch linux reproducibility script
***** Specific tasks
****** TODO add test suites to build repo which tests for necessary variables and runs
****** TODO deploy all private files from private repo, or think of secure way to handle this
****** find a way to manually create ~downloads~ from qutebrowser, or do it while creating filesystem structure

***** Next tasks
****** make script work such that re-installing can be done harmlessly even on fully installed system
****** add hook to automatically track downgraded packages as well and add conditional when installing them to check if the array is not empty -> coordinate with ~downgrade~
****** possibly add pacman hook to update package lists + ~pip~ in ~monix~: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#List_of_installed_packages
****** add a test hook after every system update to ensure tracked files are the same -> think of how to update configuration files in both directions seamlessly

***** Backup
****** figure out how to restore ~personal~ data
****** figure out how to restore private dotfiles like ~neomutt~, ~ssh~, ~gnupg~ and ~pass~ files -> to fully emulate current distribution
****** re-arrange system to keep personal data in single location, which should be backed up regularly
