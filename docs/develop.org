** Tasks
*** Arch linux reproducibility script
***** Specific extra minimal tasks
****** TODO find a way to manually create ~downloads~ from qutebrowser, or do it while creating filesystem structure
****** TODO deploy all private files from private repo, or think of secure way to handle this -> adjust ~dotfiles~ as well since GPG key is needed to commit

***** Next tasks
****** make script work such that re-installing can be done harmlessly even on fully installed system
****** add hook to automatically track downgraded packages as well and add conditional when installing them to check if the array is not empty -> coordinate with ~downgrade~
****** add a new test suite to check for downgraded packages
****** possibly add pacman hook to update package lists + ~pip~ in ~monix~: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#List_of_installed_packages
****** add a test hook after every system update to ensure tracked files are the same -> think of how to update configuration files in both directions seamlessly
****** add a hook to convert all optional (non-true) orphans to explicit packages -> or at least to check them after each upgrade -> ~pacman -Qttdq~ 

***** Backup
****** figure out how to restore ~personal~ data
****** figure out how to restore private dotfiles like ~neomutt~, ~ssh~, ~gnupg~ and ~pass~ files -> to fully emulate current distribution
****** re-arrange system to keep personal data in single location, which should be backed up regularly
