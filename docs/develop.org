** Tasks
**** Long-term
***** File-system encryption
****** practice this on new phyiscal system in September 
****** practice this on virtual machine with new ~dotfiles~ workflows as well
****** reinstall arch on own hardware with encrypted version
****** add this information to readme pre-monix

***** Sync and verify
****** think about adding ~sync~ functionality in case tests fail, which automatically corrects tests instead of expecting the user to do this manually
****** test all of these changes with virtual machine, but try to keep cache of packages instead of always re-installing -> think of the best way to do this, maybe with a shared folder
 
***** Installation workflow
****** EITHER consider replacing ~cp~ with ~rsync~, which can preserve directory trees -> can encode directories similar to ~stow~ but with hard files instead of links
****** OR consider combining home and root partitions, such that ~stow~ can be used with symlinks
******* need to think more about the practicality and necessity of this
******* perhaps hard-copies are enough since root-level configuration files are not likely to change
        
***** Downgrade
****** add pacman hook to update downgraded packages when feature is available upstream
****** add workflow to install ~downgrade~ packages from a file when available upstream
******* add conditional when installing to check array is not empty
******* add conditional to do an emptiness check for ~pip~ packages as well
****** add a new test suite to check for downgraded packages sanity

***** Packages 
****** look through ~pacman~ package list and remove unnecessary packages
